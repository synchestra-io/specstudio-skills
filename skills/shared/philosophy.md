# SDD Skill Philosophy

**Status:** Shared principles
**Applies to:** `specstudio:ideate`, `specstudio:specify`, and future SDD skills

These principles are inherited from both upstream skills (Jobs/Ive simplicity ethos from `idea-refine`; YAGNI/isolation discipline from `brainstorming`) and shaped to fit SpecScore's typed-artifact stance.

## Core Principles

1. **Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.** Push toward the simplest version that still solves the real problem.
2. **Start with the user experience; work backwards to technology.** Not the reverse.
3. **Say no to 1,000 things.** Focus beats breadth. The "Not Doing" list is the most valuable part of any artifact.
4. **Challenge every assumption.** "How it's usually done" is not a reason. Name your bets; validate the ones that can kill the idea.
5. **Show people the future — don't just give them better horses.** Ideate beyond what the user initially asked for.
6. **The parts you can't see should be as beautiful as the parts you can.** Internal APIs, module boundaries, and data shapes deserve the same care as UI.

## Artifact Principles

7. **Unsaved ideation is waste.** If it's worth thinking about, it's worth a lint-clean `spec/` artifact.
8. **Types beat vibes.** Every SpecScore artifact has a schema. If lint passes, we can build on it. If it doesn't, we can't.
9. **Git history is the revision record.** Revise in place; rename only when scope changes invalidate the artifact's identity.
10. **Stable IDs, mutable content.** Slugs are contracts — they're referenced across the codebase. Don't rename them.

## Interaction Principles

11. **Be honest, not supportive.** A good skill is not a yes-machine. Push back on weak ideas with specificity and kindness.
12. **One question at a time when clarity is low.** Batch only when you already have context.
13. **Multiple-choice beats open-ended** when the axes of choice are known. Use open-ended when the space itself is unclear.
14. **Don't narrate; produce.** The user can read the diff. Keep intermediate text short; save depth for the artifact.
15. **Gates are non-negotiable.** When a skill has a HARD-GATE, no amount of perceived simplicity bypasses it.

## Process Principles

16. **Isolation and clarity.** Each unit — module, requirement, acceptance criterion — has one clear purpose and a well-defined interface.
17. **YAGNI ruthlessly.** Remove unrequested features from every draft.
18. **Scope decomposition before refinement.** If the request spans multiple independent subsystems, decompose first; don't refine details of a project that needs splitting.
19. **Verification is evidence, not vibes.** Every skill ends with a verification checklist. "Seems right" is not verification.
20. **Fix root causes, not symptoms.** If lint fails, understand why. If an assumption is wrong, don't paper over it.
