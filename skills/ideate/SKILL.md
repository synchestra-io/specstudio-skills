# Ideate

Turn raw ideas into sharp, SpecScore-compatible Idea artifacts through structured divergent and convergent thinking.

## Hard Gate

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke `specstudio:specify`, `writing-plans`, or any implementation skill until:
  1. An Idea artifact has been written to `spec/ideas/<slug>.md`.
  2. `specscore lint spec/ideas/<slug>.md` passes.
  3. The user has explicitly approved the Recommended Direction.

Ideas that can't be lint-clean aren't ready to be specified.
</HARD-GATE>

## When to Use

- Raw, vague, or unvalidated concept.
- User unsure whether an idea is worth building.
- Multiple possible directions with no clear winner.
- **Skip** when: the user already has an approved Idea or a clear, high-conviction feature to specify — go straight to `specstudio:specify`.

## Philosophy

See [philosophy.md](../shared/philosophy.md). Key tenets here: *simplicity is the ultimate sophistication*, *say no to 1,000 things*, *challenge every assumption*, *unsaved ideation is waste*, *prefer stable CLI contracts over ad-hoc file writes when both are possible*.

## Path Conventions

Artifacts land at `spec/ideas/<slug>.md`. See [path-conventions.md](../shared/path-conventions.md). Never use `docs/ideas/`.

If `spec/ideas/` does not exist when the skill is invoked, **bootstrap it** before writing the first artifact: create the directory and a lint-clean `spec/ideas/README.md` index (`type: index`, empty Contents table, `Outstanding Questions: None at this time.`). Tell the user explicitly that you bootstrapped it. Never silent.

## Checklist

Create a task for each and complete in order:

1. **Explore project context** — existing Features, architecture, related Ideas (`Glob`, `Grep`, `Read`).
2. **Scope decomposition check** — if the request describes multiple independent subsystems, stop and help the user split into multiple Ideas before proceeding.
3. **Phase 1 — Understand & Expand** (divergent).
4. **Phase 2 — Evaluate & Converge**.
5. **Phase 3 — Crystallize** as a SpecScore Idea artifact. Bootstrap `spec/ideas/` if missing. Prefer the `specscore new idea` CLI scaffold over a direct file write when the CLI is available (see Phase 3 below).
6. **Lint** the artifact: `specscore lint spec/ideas/<slug>.md`. On failure, run `specscore lint --fix` once, re-lint; surface remaining violations to the user.
7. **Auto-stage** every file you created (`spec/ideas/<slug>.md`, plus the bootstrap files if any) with `git add`. Tell the user the staged paths. Never commit on the user's behalf.
8. **Inline self-review** — placeholders, contradictions, ambiguity, scope.
9. **User review** — ask the user to review and approve the Recommended Direction. Recognize explicit approval phrases (`approve`, `approved`, `accept`, `accepted`, `lgtm`, plus their semantic equivalents in the user's language); treat vague positive signals as soft and ask one explicit confirmation question.
10. **Emit events** — `idea.drafted` on every successful lint pass while `status: Draft`; `idea.approved` exactly once on approval; `idea.updated` on every successful lint pass while `status: Approved`. Both `drafted` and `updated` payloads carry `changed_sections`, `previous_revision`, and a factual `change_summary` (≤2 sentences). See [synchestra-events.md](../shared/synchestra-events.md).

## Phase 1 — Understand & Expand (Divergent)

**Goal:** Open the idea up before narrowing.

1. **Restate as a "How Might We…"** sentence. Forces clarity on what's actually being solved.
2. **Ask 3–5 sharpening questions** (batched — see [question-cadence.md](../shared/question-cadence.md)). Focus:
   - Who is this for, specifically?
   - What does success look like?
   - What are the real constraints (time, tech, resources)?
   - What's been tried before?
   - Why now?

   Use `AskUserQuestion`. Do NOT proceed until you know *who* and *success*.

3. **Generate 5–8 variations** using these lenses:
   - **Inversion** — what if we did the opposite?
   - **Constraint removal** — what if budget/time/tech weren't factors?
   - **Audience shift** — what if this were for a different user?
   - **Combination** — what if we merged this with an adjacent idea?
   - **Simplification** — what's the version that's 10x simpler?
   - **10x** — what would this look like at massive scale?
   - **Expert lens** — what would domain experts find obvious?

   Push beyond what the user asked for. See [frameworks.md](references/frameworks.md) for additional frameworks (SCAMPER, JTBD, First Principles, Pre-mortem, Analogous Inspiration). Pick the lens that fits — don't run every framework mechanically.

**If inside a codebase:** ground variations in what actually exists. Reference specific files and patterns.

## Phase 2 — Evaluate & Converge

After the user reacts to Phase 1, shift to convergent mode. Cadence becomes **single question at a time**.

1. **Cluster** ideas that resonated into 2–3 meaningfully different directions.
2. **Stress-test** each direction on three axes — see [refinement-criteria.md](references/refinement-criteria.md):
   - **User value** (painkiller vs. vitamin)
   - **Feasibility** (technical + resource + time-to-value)
   - **Differentiation** (new capability? 10x? new audience? new context? better UX?)
3. **Surface hidden assumptions** in three tiers:
   - **Must be true** (dealbreakers — validate before building)
   - **Should be true** (significant impact, but recoverable)
   - **Might be true** (secondary; don't validate yet)

**Be honest, not supportive.** If a direction is weak, say so with specificity and kindness.

## Phase 3 — Crystallize as a SpecScore Idea

**Prefer the CLI when available.** `specscore new idea <slug>` produces a lint-clean skeleton by construction and updates `spec/ideas/README.md` for you. Subsequent edits must preserve that lint-clean state.

### Step 3.0 — Bootstrap `spec/ideas/` if missing

Before invoking the CLI or writing the file directly, check that `spec/ideas/` exists. If not:

1. Create the directory.
2. Create `spec/ideas/README.md` as a lint-clean Index artifact (`type: index`, `status: Stable`, empty Contents table, `Outstanding Questions: None at this time.`). The CLI will append to this index when it scaffolds the artifact; the fallback path appends manually.
3. Tell the user, e.g., *"Bootstrapped `spec/ideas/` and `spec/ideas/README.md` (this project didn't have an ideas tree yet)."*

This step MUST NOT happen silently.

### Step 3a — Detect the CLI

Probe once with Bash:

```bash
command -v specscore >/dev/null 2>&1 && specscore --version
```

If the probe succeeds, take the **CLI path**. Otherwise, take the **fallback path**.

### Step 3b (CLI path) — Scaffold, then fill

1. Invoke `specscore new idea <slug>` with every field you already have. Only these flags exist — do not invent others:

   - `--title`
   - `--owner`
   - `--hmw` (Problem Statement)
   - `--context`
   - `--recommended-direction`
   - `--mvp`
   - `--not-doing` (repeatable; format `<thing> — <reason>`)
   - `--force` (only if overwriting an existing draft at the same slug)
   - `--project` (only if cwd isn't inside the target repo)

   Example:

   ```bash
   specscore new idea my-slug \
     --title "My Idea" \
     --owner "alex" \
     --hmw "How might we …?" \
     --context "Triggered by …" \
     --recommended-direction "We should …" \
     --mvp "A two-week spike that …" \
     --not-doing "Multi-tenant auth — out of scope for MVP" \
     --not-doing "iOS client — web-first"
   ```

   The command writes `spec/ideas/<slug>.md`, runs lint-fix, and exits non-zero if the result isn't lint-clean.

2. **Fill remaining sections with `Edit`.** Sections with no matching flag — `Alternatives Considered`, `Key Assumptions to Validate` (the Must/Should/Might table), `SpecScore Integration`, `Open Questions` — land in the file as HTML-comment prompts. Replace each prompt with real content via `Edit`. Sections you *did* pass via flags are already filled.

### Step 3c (fallback path) — Direct write

If the CLI is not on PATH, write the file directly using the schema below. The content must be identical to what the CLI would produce.

### Step 3d — Lint (with bounded auto-recovery)

In both paths, after the artifact is complete, run `specscore lint spec/ideas/<slug>.md`. The CLI scaffold is lint-clean on generation; your subsequent `Edit`s must not break that.

**On lint failure:**

1. Run `specscore lint --fix spec/ideas/<slug>.md` exactly once.
2. Re-run `specscore lint spec/ideas/<slug>.md`.
3. If lint now passes: continue. Tell the user what was auto-fixed.
4. If lint still fails: surface the remaining violations to the user with rule IDs and affected sections. Do NOT loop `--fix`.

**Trust the CLI's fix policy.** The skill does NOT carry its own list of which lint rules are safely auto-fixable — that policy lives in the `specscore` CLI. If `--fix` silently repairs a violation that should require human input, file the issue against `specscore`, not this skill.

### Step 3e — Auto-stage in git

After every successful artifact write or edit, stage the affected paths:

```bash
git add spec/ideas/<slug>.md
# plus any bootstrap files you created in Step 3.0
git add spec/ideas/README.md
```

Report the staged paths to the user in the same response. Never run `git commit` — staging only. If staging fails (no git repo, detached worktree, lock contention), surface the failure and continue without aborting the artifact write.

### Schema (authoritative — used by both paths)

Write to `spec/ideas/<slug>.md` using **exactly this schema**:

```markdown
---
type: idea
id: idea-<slug>
status: Draft
date: YYYY-MM-DD
owner: <author>
promotes_to: []          # Managed by Synchestra. Do NOT edit manually.
supersedes: []
---

# <Idea Name>

## Problem Statement
<One "How Might We…" sentence>

## Context
<Triggering observation, related specs, prior art>

## Recommended Direction
<2–3 paragraphs: what and why, over the alternatives>

## Alternatives Considered
<2–3 directions that lost, and why each lost>

## MVP Scope
<The single job the MVP nails. Timeboxed, not feature-listed. "If it's not embarrassing, you waited too long.">

## Not Doing (and Why)
- <Thing 1> — <reason>
- <Thing 2> — <reason>
- <Thing 3> — <reason>

## Key Assumptions to Validate
| Tier | Assumption | How to validate |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| Must-be-true | … | … |
| Should-be-true | … | … |
| Might-be-true | … | … |

## SpecScore Integration
- **New Features this would create:** <list or "TBD at spec time">
- **Existing Features affected:** <list or "none">
- **Dependencies:** <other Ideas or in-flight work>

## Open Questions
- <Question that needs answering before promotion to Feature(s)>
```

**The "Not Doing" list is mandatory** — lint rule `I-002` will fail without it.

## Inline Self-Review

Look at the written artifact with fresh eyes. Check for:

- **Placeholders** — `TBD`, `TODO`, `???`. Fix in place.
- **Internal consistency** — does the Recommended Direction match the MVP Scope? Do the assumptions line up?
- **Scope** — is this one Idea or three smuggled into one?
- **Ambiguity** — could a reader interpret a requirement two ways?

Fix inline. Don't re-review; move on.

## User Review Gate

After lint + self-review pass:

> "Idea drafted and lint-clean at `spec/ideas/<slug>.md`. Please review the Recommended Direction and MVP Scope. Approve to move to specify, or request changes."

Wait. If the user requests changes, make them, re-lint (with the auto-recovery flow above), re-stage, and emit a fresh `idea.drafted` event. Only proceed once the user approves.

### Recognizing approval

**Explicit approval — transition immediately, no confirmation prompt:**

The following phrases (case-insensitive, optional surrounding punctuation) count as unambiguous approval:

- English: `approve`, `approved`, `accept`, `accepted`, `lgtm`
- Direct semantic equivalents in any language the user is communicating in: `aprobar` / `aprobado` (Spanish), `approuver` / `approuvé` (French), `承認` / `承認する` (Japanese), `одобрить` / `одобрено` / `принято` (Russian), `批准` / `同意` (Chinese), `genehmigen` / `genehmigt` (German), and so on.

The criterion is semantic, not lexical: the phrase must function as a verb form meaning "I give explicit approval" in the source language. Recognize it when the phrase is the standalone response or the dominant content of a short response. If the phrase appears only incidentally in a longer message ("we should approve this approach but I have one concern…"), do NOT treat it as approval — address the concern first.

**Vague positive signals — ask one explicit confirmation question:**

Phrases like `looks good`, `yeah`, `nice`, `ship it`, `+1`, `🚀`, `confirm`, `yes`, `ok`, `sí`, `oui`, `да`, `はい`, `好` are NOT explicit approval. They signal positive sentiment but are ambiguous in conversational context. On detecting one, respond with a single confirmation prompt:

> "Treat that as approval?"

Wait for the user. Proceed only on a follow-up explicit phrase. Never silently transition status on a vague signal.

### On confirmed approval

- Update `status: Draft → Approved` in the front-matter.
- Re-run lint.
- Emit `idea.approved` event (exactly once per Idea).

## Post-Approval Iteration

Once `status: Approved`, the Idea is alive but not frozen. The user MAY edit it further (refine the Recommended Direction, add an Open Question, update assumptions). On every subsequent successful lint pass after a write or edit:

- Status remains `Approved` (never roll back to `Draft`).
- Emit `idea.updated` (NOT `idea.drafted`).
- Do NOT re-emit `idea.approved`.
- Re-stage the changed file with `git add`.

`idea.updated` is the signal Synchestra uses to notify Features that declare this Idea as a `Source Ideas` entry, so downstream specs can reconcile.

### Computing the change-context payload

Both `idea.drafted` (re-emissions) and `idea.updated` events carry three change-context fields. Compute them before emission:

- **`previous_revision`** — the git SHA at which the previous emission of the same event fired (for `idea.updated`, the SHA at which `idea.approved` last fired, or the previous `idea.updated`; for `idea.drafted` re-emissions, the SHA of the prior `idea.drafted`). On the very first `idea.drafted` for an Idea, this is `null`.
- **`changed_sections`** — list of H2 section names whose content differs between `previous_revision` and the current revision. H3 changes within a section roll up to the parent H2. Computed by parsing both versions and comparing per-section. `null` on the first `idea.drafted`.
- **`change_summary`** — a string of at most two sentences describing the change. **Factual only.** Describe what content was added, removed, or modified, in which section. Do NOT speculate about the user's intent or motivation. Do NOT editorialize about the quality or wisdom of the change. If the only change is whitespace or formatting, say so explicitly. `null` on the first `idea.drafted`.

**Examples of disciplined `change_summary`:**

- ✅ "Replaced two paragraphs in Recommended Direction; the proposed approach now uses event sourcing instead of CRUD."
- ✅ "Added one entry to Not Doing; updated one assumption in the Should-be-true tier."
- ✅ "Whitespace and trailing-newline cleanup; no semantic content changed."

**Examples of forbidden `change_summary`:**

- ❌ "User is rethinking the approach because of performance concerns." *(speculates about motivation)*
- ❌ "This change makes the spec more aligned with industry best practices." *(editorializes)*
- ❌ "Important changes to the recommended direction." *(vague; not factual)*

## Promotion to Feature(s)

**Out of scope for this skill.** Synchestra handles promotion:

1. When `specstudio:specify` (or the user) creates a Feature with `source_idea: <idea-id>` in its front-matter, Synchestra detects the link.
2. Synchestra transitions the Idea `status: Approved → Specified`.
3. Synchestra auto-populates the Idea's `promotes_to` with the list of Feature IDs.
4. Synchestra emits `idea.specified`.

**Do not manually edit `promotes_to`.** It's managed state.

## Verification

- [ ] Artifact exists at `spec/ideas/<slug>.md`
- [ ] `spec/ideas/` and `spec/ideas/README.md` exist (bootstrap if needed; never silent)
- [ ] `specscore lint` passes (auto-recovery via `--fix` attempted at most once on initial failure)
- [ ] All created files staged with `git add` and reported to user (never committed)
- [ ] "How Might We" statement, target user, success criteria all explicit
- [ ] ≥2 alternatives stress-tested
- [ ] Assumptions audited across Must/Should/Might tiers
- [ ] "Not Doing" list non-empty
- [ ] User approved the Recommended Direction (explicit phrase OR vague-signal followed by explicit confirmation)
- [ ] `status` is `Approved` (if approved) or `Draft` (if not yet)
- [ ] Events emitted per state: `idea.drafted` while Draft; `idea.approved` once on transition; `idea.updated` while Approved
- [ ] `idea.drafted` and `idea.updated` payloads include `changed_sections`, `previous_revision`, and a factual `change_summary` (all `null` on first `idea.drafted`, non-null thereafter)

## Red Flags

- Generating 20+ shallow variations vs 5–8 considered ones
- Skipping the "who is this for" question
- No assumptions surfaced before committing to a direction
- Yes-machining weak ideas instead of pushing back
- Empty "Not Doing" list
- Writing to `docs/ideas/` instead of `spec/ideas/`
- Manually editing `promotes_to`
- Jumping to `specstudio:specify` before user approval
- Silently bootstrapping `spec/ideas/` without telling the user
- Looping `specscore lint --fix` more than once
- Encoding the skill's own list of "rules `--fix` shouldn't touch" — that policy belongs to the `specscore` CLI; if it gets it wrong, fix it there
- Treating `yes` / `ok` / `sí` / `oui` / `+1` / `🚀` as explicit approval (silent status transition on vague signal)
- Running `git commit` instead of `git add` (skill stages, never commits)
- Emitting `idea.drafted` for an Approved artifact, or re-emitting `idea.approved`
- Speculating about user intent or editorializing in `change_summary` ("User is rethinking…", "Important changes…", "More aligned with best practices…") instead of describing the observable change in factual terms
- `change_summary` longer than two sentences
- Including `changed_sections` line numbers (consumers compute lines from `git diff <previous_revision>..<revision>` — payload carries section names only)

## Tone

Direct, thoughtful, slightly provocative. A sharp thinking partner, not a facilitator reading from a script.
