# Scenario: User approval transitions status and emits idea.approved

**Validates:** [ideate#ac:lifecycle-events](../README.md#ac-lifecycle-events)

## Steps

GIVEN the skill has written `spec/ideas/my-idea.md` for the first time
AND `specscore lint` exits zero on that artifact
WHEN the first-write completes
THEN the skill emits `idea.drafted`
AND the artifact's front-matter `status` is `Draft`

GIVEN the skill has presented the lint-clean artifact to the user for review
WHEN the user explicitly approves the Recommended Direction
THEN the skill updates the front-matter `status` from `Draft` to `Approved`
AND the skill re-runs `specscore lint spec/ideas/my-idea.md`
AND lint still exits zero
AND the skill emits `idea.approved`

GIVEN the user has NOT yet explicitly approved
WHEN the skill is asked to advance status
THEN the skill refuses
AND no `idea.approved` event is emitted
AND the front-matter `status` remains `Draft`
