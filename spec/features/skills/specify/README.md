# Feature: Specify Skill

> [View in Spec Studio](https://specstudio.synchestra.io/project/features?id=spec-studio@synchestra-io@github.com&path=spec%2Ffeatures%2Fskills%2Fspecify) — graph, discussions, approvals

**Status:** In Progress

## Summary

The `spec-studio:specify` skill turns an approved SpecScore Idea — or a clear buildable intent — into a lint-clean SpecScore Feature with requirements and `Given / When / Then` acceptance criteria. Its output (`spec/features/<slug>/`) is the gating input for `spec-studio:plan` and any implementation skill. Unlike `ideate` (single-file artifact), `specify` produces a multi-file directory with a README, one requirement per file, optional Rehearse stubs, and optional assets. Implementation lives at [`skills/specify/`](../../../../skills/specify/).

## Problem

Even when an Idea is well-formed, the jump from "approved direction" to "buildable contract" is non-trivial. Without a structured skill, that jump happens ad-hoc: requirements get scattered into prose, acceptance criteria get omitted or written as vibes, the Source Idea linkage gets lost, Rehearse stubs are forgotten, and the Feature ends up as a description rather than a contract that downstream skills (`plan`, `build`, `verify`) can consume.

`specify` exists to enforce the structural discipline of a SpecScore Feature — typed front-matter, requirement decomposition, G/W/T ACs, reviewer-subagent quality gate, Rehearse coverage decision — without forcing the user to memorize the schema. The Feature defines exactly what that discipline must look like, so the artifact is machine-verifiable and downstream skills can rely on it.

## Behavior

### Invocation and skip conditions

The skill is invoked when an Idea has been approved, or when the user has clear buildable intent that bypasses the ideation phase.

#### REQ: invocation-triggers

The skill MUST respond to the triggers `specify`, `/specify`, "spec this out", and the Synchestra event `idea.approved`. It MAY respond to additional natural-language phrasings of the same intent.

#### REQ: accepts-idea-or-intent

The skill MUST accept two kinds of input: (a) an approved Idea (path to `spec/ideas/<slug>.md` with front-matter `status: Approved`), or (b) a clear buildable intent stated directly by the user. When (a) is the input, the skill MUST load the Idea and surface its assumptions, alternatives, and Not-Doing list as initial Feature material. When (b) is the input, the skill MUST still elicit the same structural elements before proceeding.

#### REQ: clear-intent-criterion

For the no-Idea path, "clear buildable intent" is satisfied when the user can articulate the problem, the recommended direction, and an explicit Not-Doing boundary in one short statement. If the intent fails this criterion, the skill MUST recommend running `spec-studio:ideate` first instead of producing a low-quality Feature.

### Hard gate

The skill enforces a hard gate downstream — once invoked, it must produce a complete, lint-clean, reviewer-approved, user-approved Feature before any other Spec Studio skill can run.

#### REQ: hard-gate

The skill MUST NOT invoke `writing-plans`, `frontend-design`, `mcp-builder`, or ANY implementation skill until ALL FIVE conditions hold:

1. The Feature artifact exists at `spec/features/<slug>/README.md` plus at least one `spec/features/<slug>/requirements/*.md`.
2. Each requirement has ≥1 acceptance criterion in `Given / When / Then` format.
3. `specscore lint spec/features/<slug>/` exits zero.
4. The spec-document reviewer subagent returned `Approved`.
5. The user has explicitly approved the written Feature.

A skill invocation that bypasses any condition is a contract violation.

### Artifact location and structure

Feature artifacts have one canonical location and a fixed multi-file shape.

#### REQ: artifact-path

The skill MUST write Feature artifacts under `spec/features/<slug>/` relative to the project root. The `<slug>` MUST be lowercase, hyphen-separated, URL-safe, and stable for the artifact's lifetime.

#### REQ: artifact-structure

The Feature directory MUST contain a `README.md` (the Feature spec per the SpecScore Feature schema) and a `requirements/` subdirectory with at least one `<req-slug>.md` requirement file. Optional sub-directories: `_tests/` (Rehearse scenarios), `assets/` (diagrams, mockups), `proposals/` (post-Stable change requests).

#### REQ: no-docs-path

The skill MUST NOT write Feature artifacts to `docs/features/`, `docs/superpowers/specs/`, `notes/`, or any path other than `spec/features/<slug>/`. `docs/` is reserved for prose documentation; SpecScore artifacts live under `spec/`.

#### REQ: auto-create-features-dir

When invoked in a project that does not yet have a `spec/features/` directory, the skill MUST create the directory and a lint-clean `spec/features/README.md` index file before writing the first Feature. The auto-created index MUST be lint-clean (`type: index`, empty Contents table, "None at this time." Outstanding Questions). Auto-creation MUST NOT happen silently — the skill MUST tell the user it is bootstrapping the directory.

### Schema and front-matter

The Feature artifact conforms to the canonical SpecScore Feature spec.

#### REQ: feature-schema-conformance

The Feature `README.md` MUST follow the SpecScore Feature template: `# Feature: <Title>` heading, `**Status:**` field immediately after, `## Summary` (1–3 sentences), `## Problem`, `## Behavior` (with `#### REQ: <slug>` rules under topic headings), `## Acceptance Criteria` (with `### AC: <slug>` blocks bundling REQs), `## Outstanding Questions`, and the adherence footer.

#### REQ: feature-status-domain

The front-matter `status` MUST be one of: `Draft`, `In Progress`, `Stable`, `Deprecated`. The skill MUST set `status: Draft` on initial write and transition to `In Progress` (or higher, on user instruction) only after explicit approval.

#### REQ: requirement-front-matter

Each requirement file MUST have YAML front-matter including `type: requirement`, `id: req-<feat-slug>-<req-slug>`, `feature: feat-<slug>`, and `status`. The body MUST contain a one-paragraph description and at least one `### AC-<n>: <name>` block in `Given / When / Then` form.

#### REQ: ac-format

Every acceptance criterion MUST use `Given / When / Then` form. This corresponds to lint rule `F-004`. ACs that cannot be phrased as `Then <observable outcome>` MUST be sharpened or removed; abstract aspirations are not acceptance criteria.

### Source Idea linkage

When a Feature originates from an Idea, the linkage is declared by the Feature.

#### REQ: source-idea-field

When the Feature originates from one or more approved Ideas, the Feature `README.md` MUST declare them via a `**Source Ideas:** <slug>, <slug>, ...` body-metadata line immediately after the `**Status:**` field. Every listed slug MUST resolve to an existing Idea at `spec/ideas/<slug>.md` with `Status ∈ {Approved, Specified}`.

#### REQ: no-manual-promotes-to

The skill MUST NOT manually edit any referenced Idea's `promotes_to` or `Status` field. Synchestra reconciles those in response to the Feature declaring its `Source Ideas`. The Feature is the only authoritative input; the Idea side is managed.

### CLI vs fallback path

Crystallization prefers a stable CLI contract over ad-hoc file writes when one becomes available.

#### REQ: cli-preferred

When a `specscore new feature` (or equivalent) CLI command is on PATH, the skill MUST use it to scaffold the Feature directory, passing every field it already has via documented flags. The skill MUST NOT invent flags.

#### REQ: fallback-direct-write

When no scaffolding CLI is available, the skill MUST fall back to direct file writes using the authoritative SpecScore Feature schema. CLI and fallback paths MUST produce schema-equivalent artifacts (identical front-matter, identical sections, identical required content). They MAY differ in cosmetic ways (whitespace, blank lines, comment style).

### Lint and self-review

Every artifact passes through machine validation, automated repair, and a deliberate human-style review.

#### REQ: lint-pass

After writing or editing the Feature, the skill MUST run `specscore lint spec/features/<slug>/` and confirm a zero exit code before proceeding to the reviewer subagent.

#### REQ: lint-failure-recovery

On `specscore lint` failure, the skill MUST:

1. Run `specscore lint --fix spec/features/<slug>/` exactly once.
2. Re-run `specscore lint spec/features/<slug>/` to verify.
3. If passing, continue and tell the user what was auto-fixed.
4. If still failing, surface remaining violations to the user with rule IDs and affected files.

The skill MUST NOT loop `--fix` more than once. The skill MUST NOT auto-fix violations that require human input — at minimum, missing `Source Ideas` references, ACs that are not in G/W/T form, and empty Outstanding Questions sections.

#### REQ: inline-self-review

Before dispatching the reviewer subagent, the skill MUST scan the Feature for: (a) unresolved placeholders (`TBD`, `TODO`, `???`, `FIXME`), (b) internal contradictions (architecture vs. requirements, requirements vs. ACs), (c) hidden multi-Feature scope, and (d) requirements interpretable two ways. Findings MUST be fixed inline.

### Reviewer subagent gate

A subagent provides a structured second opinion on the spec before the user sees it.

#### REQ: reviewer-subagent-required

The skill MUST dispatch the spec-document reviewer subagent (per the prompt at `skills/specify/references/reviewer-prompt.md`) after lint passes and before presenting the Feature to the user. The subagent's verdict MUST be `Approved` before the User Review Gate runs. On `Issues Found`, the skill MUST address every blocker-severity finding and re-dispatch the subagent. Advisory recommendations MAY be ignored.

### User review and approval

The user — not the skill, not the subagent — owns the final approval decision.

#### REQ: user-approval-required

After the reviewer subagent returns `Approved`, the skill MUST present the Feature to the user with an explicit request for approval. The skill MUST NOT proceed to status transition or `feature.approved` event emission without that approval.

#### REQ: approval-explicit-phrase

The skill MUST recognize the same explicit-approval phrase set as `spec-studio:ideate`: English `approve`, `approved`, `accept`, `accepted`, `lgtm`, plus their direct semantic equivalents in any language the user is communicating in (e.g., `aprobar`, `承認`, `одобрено`, `批准`). The criterion is semantic — the phrase must function as a verb form meaning "I give explicit approval" in the source language. On detection of any qualifying phrase as a standalone or dominant response, the skill MUST proceed directly to the status transition.

#### REQ: approval-vague-confirmation

When the user's response signals positive sentiment but does not contain a recognized explicit phrase (e.g., `looks good`, `yeah`, `nice`, `ship it`, `+1`, `🚀`, `yes`, `ok`, `sí`, `oui`, `да`, `はい`), the skill MUST treat this as a soft signal and ask one explicit confirmation question (e.g., "Treat that as approval?") before proceeding. The skill MUST NOT silently transition status on a vague signal.

#### REQ: status-transition-on-approval

On confirmed user approval, the skill MUST update the Feature's front-matter `status` from `Draft` to `In Progress` (the SpecScore equivalent of an approved-but-iterating Feature), re-run lint, and emit `feature.approved`.

### Rehearse stub decision

For each AC, a per-AC decision determines whether to scaffold a Rehearse test stub.

#### REQ: rehearse-per-ac-decision

For every AC in the Feature, the skill MUST apply the heuristic in [`shared/rehearse-heuristic.md`](../../../../skills/shared/rehearse-heuristic.md). When the AC is testable (CLI, HTTP, pure function, data, UI selector, filesystem, or event surface), the skill MUST scaffold `spec/features/<slug>/_tests/<scenario-slug>.md` with `status: pending`. When the AC is not testable, the skill MUST record the skip-reason in the Feature `README.md` under a `## Rehearse Integration` subsection.

#### REQ: user-can-override-rehearse

The user MAY override the heuristic at any point — both directions (force a stub for a deemed-untestable AC, or skip a stub for a deemed-testable AC). The override MUST be recorded with reasoning.

### Auto-stage in git

Files the skill creates are staged for the user but never committed.

#### REQ: auto-stage-on-create

When the skill creates files (the bootstrapped `spec/features/`, `spec/features/README.md`, the Feature directory and its contents, Rehearse stubs), it MUST `git add` those paths to the index and report the staged paths to the user. The skill MUST NOT commit on the user's behalf. If staging fails (no git repository, lock contention), the skill MUST surface the failure and continue without aborting the artifact write.

### Event emission

The skill participates in the Synchestra event vocabulary.

#### REQ: event-specified

The skill MUST emit `feature.specified` after the reviewer subagent returns `Approved` and lint passes — that is, when the Feature is structurally and qualitatively ready for user review. The first emission for a Feature carries `previous_revision: null`; subsequent emissions during reviewer iteration carry the previous revision.

#### REQ: event-approved

The skill MUST emit `feature.approved` exactly once, after the user approves the Feature and the status transition Draft → In Progress completes successfully.

#### REQ: event-updated

After `feature.approved` has fired, the Feature is alive but not frozen (it remains `In Progress`, or the user later promotes it to `Stable`). On every successful lint pass after a subsequent write or edit, the skill MUST emit `feature.updated`. The skill MUST NOT emit `feature.specified` for an already-approved Feature, and MUST NOT re-emit `feature.approved` for further iteration.

#### REQ: event-payload-change-context

`feature.specified`, `feature.approved`, and `feature.updated` event payloads MUST carry the same change-context fields as the Idea events: `changed_sections` (H2 section names whose content differs from `previous_revision`, with H3 changes rolled up), `previous_revision` (git SHA), and `change_summary` (≤2 sentences, factual, no speculation/editorializing). On the very first `feature.specified` emission for a Feature, all three are `null`.

### Promotion boundary

The next skill is `writing-plans`, and only `writing-plans`.

#### REQ: transition-to-writing-plans

After `feature.approved`, the skill MUST transition only to `writing-plans`. The skill MUST NOT invoke any other downstream skill — no `frontend-design`, no `mcp-builder`, no implementation skill of any kind.

#### REQ: revise-vs-supersede

When the user wants to change an existing Feature, the default is to revise the Feature in place (git history is the record of evolution). The skill MUST create a successor with `supersedes: [<predecessor-slug>]` only when the scope change invalidates existing acceptance criteria. The skill MUST NOT silently delete or rewrite an existing Feature without the user's explicit choice between revise-in-place and supersede.

### Tone

#### REQ: honest-pushback

The skill MUST NOT yes-machine weak Features. When a requirement is vague, an AC is unobservable, or a Feature spans multiple subsystems, the skill MUST say so with specificity and propose the alternative. The acceptance bar is honest disagreement, not performative agreement.

## Interaction with Other Features

| Feature | Interaction |
|---|---|
| [Ideate Skill](../ideate/README.md) | `specify` is the downstream gate of `ideate`. `specify` consumes the approved Idea via `Source Ideas` linkage and surfaces its assumptions, alternatives, and Not-Doing list as initial Feature material. The `idea.approved` event triggers `specify` (with user confirmation). |
| [Plan Skill](../plan/README.md) | `specify` is the upstream gate of `plan`. `plan` consumes the approved Feature; `specify` never invokes `plan` itself — `writing-plans` is the explicit transition. |
| [SpecScore Feature](https://github.com/synchestra-io/specscore/blob/main/spec/features/feature/README.md) | The schema, lint rules, and lifecycle of the produced Feature artifact are owned by SpecScore's Feature feature. `specify` is a producer, not a definer of that schema. |
| Synchestra Events | Emits `feature.specified`, `feature.approved`, and `feature.updated`, all with change-context payloads. Consumers — including downstream Features that declare this Feature as a dependency, and Hub — observe these to advance their own state. |
| `specscore` CLI | Preferred crystallization path when a `specscore new feature` (or equivalent) command is available. The skill probes for the CLI once per invocation and falls back to direct write only when absent. |
| Rehearse | The `_tests/` directory under each Feature holds Rehearse-executable scenario files. `specify` decides per-AC whether to scaffold a stub via the rehearse-heuristic. |

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC: hard-gate-enforced

**Requirements:** specify#req:hard-gate, specify#req:lint-pass, specify#req:reviewer-subagent-required, specify#req:user-approval-required

The skill cannot invoke `writing-plans` or any implementation skill until the Feature exists with at least one requirement and ≥1 G/W/T AC, `specscore lint` passes, the reviewer subagent returns `Approved`, and the user has approved the Feature. Bypassing any condition is rejected.

### AC: artifact-conformance

**Requirements:** specify#req:artifact-path, specify#req:no-docs-path, specify#req:auto-create-features-dir, specify#req:auto-stage-on-create, specify#req:artifact-structure, specify#req:feature-schema-conformance, specify#req:requirement-front-matter, specify#req:ac-format

Every produced Feature lives under `spec/features/<slug>/` with the canonical multi-file structure (README + requirements/ + optional _tests/, assets/), conforms to the SpecScore Feature schema, has front-matter with the right shape on both the Feature README and each requirement file, and uses `Given / When / Then` for every AC. When `spec/features/` does not exist, the skill bootstraps it (with a lint-clean index) and tells the user. All created files are staged in git; the skill never commits.

### AC: source-idea-linkage

**Requirements:** specify#req:source-idea-field, specify#req:no-manual-promotes-to, specify#req:accepts-idea-or-intent

When a Feature originates from one or more approved Ideas, the Feature declares them via `**Source Ideas:**`. Every referenced Idea exists with `Status ∈ {Approved, Specified}`; missing or wrong-status references are rejected by lint. The skill never edits the referenced Idea's `promotes_to` or `Status` directly — Synchestra reconciles those.

### AC: cli-vs-fallback

**Requirements:** specify#req:cli-preferred, specify#req:fallback-direct-write

When a `specscore new feature` (or equivalent) CLI is on PATH, the skill uses it; otherwise it falls back to direct write. Both paths produce schema-equivalent Features (identical front-matter, sections, required content) — cosmetic differences are allowed.

### AC: lint-and-recovery

**Requirements:** specify#req:lint-pass, specify#req:lint-failure-recovery

After each write/edit, lint is run; on failure, `specscore lint --fix` is attempted exactly once before re-lint. If still failing, remaining violations are surfaced to the user with rule IDs and affected files. The skill never loops `--fix`, never auto-fixes violations that require human input.

### AC: reviewer-then-user

**Requirements:** specify#req:reviewer-subagent-required, specify#req:user-approval-required

The reviewer subagent must return `Approved` before the user is shown the Feature. On `Issues Found`, every blocker is addressed and the subagent is re-dispatched. The user's approval is independent of and downstream from the subagent's; both are required.

### AC: approval-detection

**Requirements:** specify#req:approval-explicit-phrase, specify#req:approval-vague-confirmation, specify#req:user-approval-required

The skill detects approval in two tiers: explicit phrases (English set + semantic equivalents in any language the user is communicating in) trigger immediate transition; vague positive signals trigger a single confirmation prompt. Silent transition on vague signals is a contract violation.

### AC: rehearse-coverage

**Requirements:** specify#req:rehearse-per-ac-decision, specify#req:user-can-override-rehearse

Every AC has a recorded Rehearse decision: either a scaffolded stub at `spec/features/<slug>/_tests/<scenario-slug>.md` with `status: pending`, or a documented skip-reason under `## Rehearse Integration` in the Feature README. The user can override either direction with reasoning.

### AC: lifecycle-events

**Requirements:** specify#req:event-specified, specify#req:event-approved, specify#req:event-updated, specify#req:event-payload-change-context, specify#req:status-transition-on-approval

`feature.specified` fires after reviewer-subagent approval and lint pass; `feature.approved` fires exactly once on user approval and the Draft → In Progress transition; `feature.updated` fires on every successful lint pass after a subsequent edit. All three carry `changed_sections`, `previous_revision`, and a factual `change_summary` (null on the first `feature.specified`, non-null thereafter). Misclassifying or skipping an emission is a contract violation.

### AC: promotion-boundary-held

**Requirements:** specify#req:transition-to-writing-plans, specify#req:revise-vs-supersede

The skill never transitions to any skill other than `writing-plans`. When the user wants to change an existing Feature, revise-in-place is the default; supersede is reserved for scope changes that invalidate existing ACs and is the user's explicit choice.

## Outstanding Questions

- Should the explicit set of "blocker-severity" reviewer findings (per `reviewer-subagent-required`) be enumerated in this Feature, or left to the reviewer prompt and a separate spec? Currently delegated.
- Should `specify` enforce a maximum requirement count per Feature (e.g., 10) to push back on multi-Feature scope smuggling, or is the decomposition check sufficient?
- What is the exact list of lint violations excluded from `specscore lint --fix` in `lint-failure-recovery`? Currently the spec lists three examples (missing Source Ideas, non-G/W/T ACs, empty Outstanding Questions); the canonical list should live in `shared/specscore-lint-rules.md` and be referenced.
- Should `feature.updated` be debounced when the user makes many small edits in succession, or always emitted per lint pass? The latter matches `idea.updated` symmetry but may produce noisy event streams during heavy iteration.
- When a user invokes `specify` with a clear intent that bypasses an existing Approved Idea, should the skill require the user to either link that Idea via `Source Ideas` or explicitly waive it? Currently silent.
- Should the status transition on user approval be `Draft → In Progress` (current spec) or `Draft → Approved`? SpecScore's Feature spec uses `In Progress`; ideate uses `Approved`. The two skills currently disagree on terminology.
