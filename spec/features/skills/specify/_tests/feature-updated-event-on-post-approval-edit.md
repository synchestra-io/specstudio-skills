# Scenario: Post-approval Feature edits emit feature.updated, never re-emit feature.specified or feature.approved

**Validates:** [specify#ac:lifecycle-events](../README.md#ac-lifecycle-events)

## Steps

GIVEN a Feature at `spec/features/checkout-v2/` with front-matter `status: In Progress`
AND `feature.approved` was previously emitted exactly once
WHEN the user edits the Feature (e.g., adds a new requirement file)
AND `specscore lint spec/features/checkout-v2/` passes
THEN the skill emits `feature.updated`
AND the skill does NOT emit `feature.specified`
AND the skill does NOT re-emit `feature.approved`
AND the front-matter `status` remains `In Progress`

GIVEN the same approved Feature is edited multiple times in succession
WHEN each edit lints clean
THEN the skill emits `feature.updated` exactly once per successful lint pass
AND the count of `feature.approved` events remains exactly 1 across all edits
AND each `feature.updated` payload carries non-null `changed_sections`, `previous_revision`, and `change_summary`

GIVEN this is the very first `feature.specified` emission for a brand-new Feature
WHEN the skill emits the event
THEN the payload's `changed_sections`, `previous_revision`, and `change_summary` are all `null`
